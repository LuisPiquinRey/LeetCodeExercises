# 🧠 LeetCode Practice in Java & JavaScript

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repo contains a collection of algorithm and data structure problems solved using **Java** and **JavaScript**. My goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core programming concepts.

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- **Java**: Object-oriented and strongly typed, great for practicing classic DSA techniques.
- **JavaScript**: Versatile and widely used in web development, also great for algorithm practice.

## 📈 Goals

- Solve problems across **all difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Cover **all major categories** (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
- Improve code readability, time/space complexity, and test coverage
